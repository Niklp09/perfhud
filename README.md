# PerfHUD
This is a small Mod that adds an `/perfhud` command that can be executed by everyone who has the `interact` privilege.

The command creates a little text HUD that currently shows two information:

1. Most laggy Mesecons chunk (needs the `mesecons_debug` mod)
2. biome_lib queue length (needs the `biome_lib` mod)
